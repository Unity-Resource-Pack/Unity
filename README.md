Updates
------
Life has been keeping me quite busy these days and I have found myself with less and less free time to work on the Unity pack with each passing day. To solve that problem, I have opened a repo for anyone to contribute to (thanks to VapourDrive for the idea).

Not all submitted textures will be merged. If I feel your textures do not fit with my current design aesthetic, I simply can't include them. The entire point of Unity is to maintain a unified look. Please do not feel discouraged if your textures aren't used; it doesn't mean they're bad, they just don't match my style.

Please note that not all textures have been updated for 1.7.10 nor have they been updated for their latest mod versions. I will be adding version notes shortly to hopefully keep things organized.

Photoshop Template
------
I hope this may be of use to those of you interested in texturing for Unity; I've tried to include as many samples and details as possible to start you off in the right direction. You can download the PSD [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2609913/Minecraft/Unity/unityTemplate.psd?dl=1 "Unity - PSD").

Mods In Progress
------
The following chart displays current mod retexture progress.

Please avoid retexturing these as it will probably be a waste of your time.
