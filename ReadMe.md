Photoshop Template
------
I hope this may be of use to those of you interested in texturing for Unity; I've tried to include as many samples and details as possible to start you off in the right direction. You can download the PSD [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d3tzqpg0ul8f9q6/unityTemplate.psd?dl=1 "Unity - PSD").


Installation
------
Click the button below to see a list of available artifacts (builds) for Unity. Simply pick one of the artifacts listed and then click the blue download link (_eg: unity-1.16-27dadd4.171018552_) to begin the download. All downloads are working resource packs and can straight into your `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder.

[![ZIP](https://github.com/CyanideX/Unity/workflows/ZIP/badge.svg?branch=1.16&event=push)](https://github.com/CyanideX/Unity/actions?query=workflow%3AZIP)

**Alternative method:** click the green _Code_ button on the top right and then click _Download ZIP_. Once you've finished downloading, un-zip the file to your `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder.
